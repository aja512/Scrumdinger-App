# Scrumdinger-App

Learn the essentials of iOS app development by building a fully functional app using SwiftUI.

## SwiftUI Overview

SwiftUI is a declarative framework for building apps for any Apple platform. Use SwiftUI to define the UI and behavior of an app using a single language and common API.

Create apps more quickly and with fewer errors with these key SwiftUI features:

* Declarative syntax — Define what views appear on screen using simple Swift structures. Your views stay up to date automatically.

* A compositional API — Quickly create and iterate your UI using built-in views and modifiers. Compose more complex views by combining simpler views.

* A powerful layout system — When existing views and controls don’t suit your needs, you can draw your own.

* Views that reflect app data — Define a view’s data dependencies, and SwiftUI automatically updates the view when data changes, avoiding errors from invalid view states.

* Automatic accessibility support — SwiftUI adds basic accessibility that you’ll learn to enhance with minimal effort.

## Tour of the App

Many software engineering teams use daily meetings, known as scrums, to plan their work for the day. 
Scrums are short meetings where each attendee discusses what they accomplished yesterday, what they are working on today, and any obstacles that might impact their work.

This module guides you through the development of Scrumdinger, an iOS app that helps users manage their daily scrums. 
To help keep scrums short and focused, Scrumdinger uses visual and audio cues to indicate when and how long each attendee should speak. 
The app also displays a progress screen that shows the time remaining in the meeting and creates a transcript that users can refer to later.
